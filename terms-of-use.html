							located in Ukraine.
						</p>

							arbitration or a court of competent jurisdiction, then this provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will
							not
							affect the legality and enforceability of all other provisions. Youzayou's failure to insist on strict adherence to or
							enforceability of any provision of these Terms of Use should not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of
							any of these Terms will be deemed a waiver of any other term or condition. Youzayou reserves the right to change this dispute
							resolution provision, but any changes will not apply to disputes arising prior to the effective date of the amendments. This
							dispute
							resolution provision will continue to apply after any interaction between you and Youzayou ends.
