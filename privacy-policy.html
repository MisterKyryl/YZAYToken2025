								select that person directly from the contact list on your device and send a text or email message from your personal account.
								You understand and agree that all costs of sending messages from your device are on you, and since this invitation is sent
								directly from your personal account, Youzayou does not have access to this correspondence and cannot control it.</li>
							<li>- We use third-party statistical tools to measure traffic and usage patterns of the Service. These tools collect information
								sent by your device or our Service, including data about the pages you visit, programs and other information that can help us
								improve the Service. We collect and use this statistical information in conjunction with statistical information about other
								Users in such a way that it is impossible to correctly extract information about any particular User from it.</li>

								of the device; or data that is sent by Youzayou to the device.</li>
							<li>- The Device ID may provide us or a third party partner with information about how you navigate and use the Service, which

								and longitude of your location will be stored with the photo and will be searchable (for example, by searching by location or
								map), provided that you made their photo public by specifying this in their privacy settings.</li>
